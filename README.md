# stock-predictor
I built a Python program that predicts whether a stock’s price will increase or decrease by the end of the day. I used the yfinance library to fetch live stock market data for around 200 companies, including popular U.S. and Indian stocks. The program first downloads the past 6 days of data and calculates the average of the last 5 closing prices for each stock. Then, it compares that average with the current day’s opening price — if the opening price is lower than the 5-day average, it predicts the stock will go UP, otherwise DOWN. After making these predictions, the program waits until the market closes and fetches the actual closing prices again. It then checks whether each prediction was correct and calculates the overall prediction accuracy percentage. I used NumPy for numerical calculations and Pandas to organize the results into a clean table showing each stock’s open price, close price, prediction, actual result, and whether it was correct. This project demonstrates how data from financial APIs can be used to make simple market predictions and evaluate their performance automatically.
